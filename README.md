# Watcher of Friends Online

The program shows in CLI a list of your VK friends who are now online.

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed.

Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Alternatively try ```pip3```.

Remember, it is recommended to use virtualenv/venv for better isolation.

Run program in CLI by ```python 8_vk_friends_online.py``` and enter your VK login and password (password is hidden).
